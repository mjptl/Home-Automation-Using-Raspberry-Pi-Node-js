# Home-Automation-Using-Raspberry-Pi-Node-js
I used Raspberry-pi (Model 3B) as client side controller and build user interface using Node-js. Using node app user can control devices at home connected with raspberry-pi.

nodeApp : this folder contents all server side files,
Ras-pi  : this folder contents conection and .py files for client side.
